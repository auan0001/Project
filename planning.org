** TODO Finish report
***  2 Working principle  
 - [ ] This chapter should present the working principle of the fermentation temperature logging system, instead of how a MCU and a SBC work.  
 - [ ] Move 2.1 - 2.4 to 3.2 Hardware and components as 3.2.1 - 3.2.4, respectively.
 - [ ] Move 2.5 to 3.3 Software and development tools as 3.3.7 HTML - HyperText Markup Language


*** 3 Implementation 8
**** 3.1 Overview of the system
- [ ] Move Figure 3.1 to 4.1 Prototype. Use a drawing in your ppt showing a schematic of the logging system, and then add text to explain what the system is made of
**** 3.2 Hardware and components
***** 3.2.2 DS18B20 temperature sensor
      - [ ] Provide a picture of the sensor as well as a short description and the specs
      3.2.3 Raspberry Pi 3B
      - [ ] Provide a picture of the Raspberry as well as a short description and the specs
      3.2.4 Arduino Nano
      - [ ] Provide a picture of the Arduino Nano as well as a short description and the specs

**** 3.3 Software and development tools
      ... 
      3.3.7 HTML - HyperText Markup Language
      - [ ] = 2.5 Web application 

*** 4 Result and discussion
  4.1 Prototype
  - [ ] Move Figure 3.1 to this section, and add text to explain it
  4.2 Web user interface 
  - [ ] The text in the current chapter
