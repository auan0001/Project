Hi Ping! Sorry for the sloppy draft. I've had to spend more time than I thought finding a BSc thesis project that I'm doing next period. 

This is a list things I have to add/improve.

- Title page
- Rewrite abstract
- IEEEtran numbering for all tables/figures/eqns
- My References back-end does not render anything from the Zotero file. At least I have the source fix until next hand-in.
- Write section about the alarm system
- More short code listing showing examples of the implementations
- Images of the web application
- Conclusions, results, discussion

See you on S4!

Best,
August Forsman
