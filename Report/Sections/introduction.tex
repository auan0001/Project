\subsection{Background}%
\label{sub:background}
In recent years, the number of small scale breweries has increased in both the commercial and homebrew market. This has led to a demand of advanced brewing systems operating on much smaller volumes compared to the macro-scale brewing industry. These systems are often equipped with sensors logging temperature and pressure. For the most common commercial beers, such as lagers, there exists optimized means of production where the temperature controls plays a big part in order to maximize yield and minimize the length of the production cycle.

An uncontrolled form of brewing, called \textit{farmhouse brewing}, focuses on letting a mixed flora of yeasts and bacteria (commonly Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus) free-rise in temperature, hence not using any control systems \cite{MixedFermentation}. The temperature influences the fermentation since the dynamics of the mixed fermentation culture varies depending on the ambient conditions. It is important to monitor several fermentations as a pre-study to learn about how the fermentation methods can be controlled in favour of the resulting beer. 

\subsection{Purpose of the project}%
\label{sub:purpose_of_the_project}
The project aims to show that a reliable homebrew fermentation temperature logging system, with data visualization, can be created using open source software and easily accessible electronics. A list of used hardware and source code of the finished product will be published to GitHub. The objective of this project is to develop a small and portable system prototype that allows an AVR based MCU to communicate with an RPi SBC through serial communication.

The RPi based server is accessed on the internet by the end user and can be visualized using external libraries compatible with the choice of database.

\subsection{Work distribution and planning}%

  \label{fig:gantt}
\end{figure}

The work planning and execution is done by one person with the help of a supervisor, which is also head of the course. As seen in Fig, the duration of the project was split into three phases with the enumerated tasks
\newpage
The time planning for the enumerated tasks is visualized as a Gantt scheme in Figure \ref{fig:gantt}.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
Set up project repository, as well as report and documentation workflow. Formulate preliminary time plan and goals. Research suitable hardware.
  \item
Get started with the AVR toolchain, write Makefiles and configure a development environment. Configure ARM compatible Linux on the RPi. Write UART routines and verify that the communication is working. Extend the communication to contain temperature data from the sensor.
  \item
    Apply a filter to the signal. Design the website, configure databases and visualization of data.
  \item
    Extend the website with more features. Collect or generate dummy-data in order to present a proof of concept.
  \item Present the project, i.e all project phases, and finalize the report.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Grading criteria}%
\label{sub:grading_criteria}
The finally revised grading criteria is
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Grade 3. The temperature is measured by the microcontroller and presented through a visualization on a website that is accessible from the internet. The website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi computer configured with an appropriate ARM compatible Linux distribution.
  \item 
   Grade 4. The temperature sensor signal can be processed through a filter. If a drastic temperature is detected, an automated script sends an alert through email. 
  \item
   Grade 5. In addition to the stated grading criteria, the data is accessed in a manner similar to an interactive process view that a production company might order as a web application. The data collection is reliable and handles unexpected errors that might affect the system.
\end{itemize}

The goals and specifications of the project is set during the beginning of the first phase but can be reformulated according to the progress. Changes to the specifications and/or grading criteria is discussed and decided by the project supervisor.
